## Installation

Use SSH to clone the project from github, with this:
git clone git@github.com:jp-king-1337/professional_portfolio.git


## Usage

This is my portfolio website, originally created to be graded as part of my participation in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Now, it serves as a place to show off the work I've done in the class and will be updated to reflect the work I do in the future.

## Credits

I previously asked questions of ChatGPT when building this site almost a month ago. For the changes I made tonight, I needed no assistance.
